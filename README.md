Ringtail Definitive Edition is a remake of an old but gold Scratch game I made back in 2022.
It's a top down bullet hell shooter where you have to take down a nefarious, evil and
hyper-realistic raccoon (technically a monster in the form of a raccoon but that's just lore stuff). 
It was created using Godot 4.3 and GDScript, but on 1/8/26 it has upgraded to use Godot 4.5.
The game is available to play on the web (in the link and itch.io), and downloadable on Windows and Linux.

<strong>General History</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The idea of the remake came up in early 2024, though I was unsure which engine to use</li>
	<li>In Summer 2024, I settled on using Godot, and started doing slow progress on a build of Ringtail</li>
	<li>However when the fall semester started, I would end up not working on it as much</li>
	<li>By Winter 2024, I decided to toss away that initial build and put more effort torwards a new build, 
	which resulted in the start of this repository.</li>
	<li>From then on until May, I would build up the game's core mechanics, such as how 
	levels were loaded, fights worked, how the player worked, etc.</li>
	<li>By May 2025, aka the end of the spring semester, I started work on the scripting of the fight, the cutscenes, and the overall aesthetics of the game</li>
	<li>In July, I would take a break from working on the game to work on the webpage to hold and promote the game</li>
	<li>On July 26, I would make the game playable to the public, though it lacked the true ending</li>
	<li>Over the next few months, I wouldn't work on it as much due to school work, but I did slowly build up the saving system</li>
	<li>In December 2025, I would work mostly on scripting the true intro/outro cutscenes</li>
	<li>After I finished the cutscenes, I would make a lot of tweaks to the game, which primarily involved the use of the saved stats</li>
	<li>On Janaury 6th 2026, Ringtail DE v1.1 would be released, with the new save system and true cutscenes</li>
</ul>

<strong>Playtesters (Date's are last time they played):</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Matt Brana (5/7) - Liked the camera and gameplay</li>
	<li>Jackson O'Brien (3/13) - Complained about Boss HP bar contrast (FIXED)</li>
	<li>April Melendez (5/1) - healing should use a chunk of power instead of slowly draining. 
	maybe it has its own cooldown like reloading? Also have it heal more when at higher hp and vice versa</li>
	<li>Alexander King (4/6) - Liked the camera, found it fun, thought Ringtail was too fast</li>
	<li>Playing with 1 HP (4/9) - I myself played RingtailHARD with 1 max hp, some things of note:
		<ol>
			<li>Able to switch weapons mid power move</li>
			<li>Able to gain power while using power</li>
			<li>Idea: Nearby boss automatic power move should only
			kick in when player is low on HP</li>
			<li>Idea: Bullets should have ability to be part of enemy/player groups</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Dylan Kelly (4/15) -Idea: Let players upload a picture of their face and have it be a boss</li>
	<li>Faded0cean (5/7) 
		<ol>
			<li>Rated hard mode 8/10 difficulty</li>
			<li>Very fun and entertaining, 
			movement is smooth and weapons are fun and powerful.</li>
			<li>Frame loss when too much on screen, 
			no warning for incoming projectiles, 
			shooting is hard when having to dodge so much.</li>
			<li>When you drain a health bar give the boss a moment where they stand still and power up, 
			it will give the player time to reload/heal. 
			Great game!</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Alexander King (6/20) - 
		<ol>
			<li>Bass boosted sound.</li>
			<li>I liked the particle effects with blood and stuff.</li>
			<li>Colors are good. The enemies stick out properly and I can tell them apart from each other despite
			them all being the same jpeg lol.</li> 
			<li>Maybe adjust the controls on the side. Like how we said, maybe
			make it so the controls pulsate or are bigger for the first few seconds or even add the load screen
			thing we spoke about.</li> 
			<li>It seemed like there were too many of Ringtail's
			small minions on screen, especially for the second round, but now after finding out I can rush him in
			close combat, this will possibly make this less of an issue. That could be a cool loading screen tip.</li> 
			<li>Change the power button to Q. Shift is too far away and Q is right there. Or make power both shift and Q.</li>
		</ol>

</ul>

<strong>Bug List:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>(4/?) - Pause menu doesn't show up soemtimes when rapidly pausing</li>
	<li>(7/31) - Web version has longer pause after loading cutscene initially</li>
</ul>
